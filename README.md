# Frances-Casiano
I'm a freshman at Parsons School of Design majoring in Strategic Design and Management. 
I'm from Puerto Rico
I've designed clothing for the past six years and been admiring big designer houses for years.
I draw a lot of my inspiration from the 1950's as well as more modern chic styles
I would describe myself as creative person; more than an artist I would consider myself a designer and writer. I feel like being artistic is a way of life and something that you are born loving and drawn to.
